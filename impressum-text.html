<br>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my 
<br>name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside 
<br>on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a 
<br>toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
<br>
<br>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most 
<br>popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that 
<br>comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. 
<br>
<br>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed 
<br>the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, 
<br>I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... 
<br>and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow 
<br>that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
<br>
<br>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got
<br>to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot 
<br>that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me 
<br>when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody 
<br>else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?
